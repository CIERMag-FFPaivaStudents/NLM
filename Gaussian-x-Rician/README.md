# Gaussian-x-Rician

Codes for comparing the efficiency of Non-Local Means using gaussian distribution and rician distribution.

## Usage

```
  Usage example:

    >>> python3 make_Comparison.py

  Images and numpy array will be generated into results folder.

  You can change the slice, the range of noise and image ponderation (T1,T2 or PD) in make_Comparison file.

  We used the following quality metrics:

    SSIM,EPI,SNR and CoC

  Article about those metrics and how they work:

  Adaptive multiresolution non-local means filter
  for three-dimensional magnetic resonance
  image denoising
